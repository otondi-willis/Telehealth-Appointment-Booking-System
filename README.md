# Telehealth Appointment Booking System Project Outline

## 1. Project Title:
**Telehealth Appointment Booking System**

## 2. Project Scope:
This project aims to develop a secure and user-friendly telehealth platform that enables patients to book, manage, and attend virtual health appointments. The system is designed with a focus on secure authentication, appointment scheduling, and efficient data management, ensuring that all user and health data is protected and compliant with privacy standards.

## 3. Expected Solution:
The solution will include a secure, scalable web-based system with the following core functionalities:

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and logout functionalities, allowing both patients and healthcare providers to access the platform.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments with healthcare providers, who can also manage their availability and view scheduled appointments.
- **Data Management**: All user, appointment, and health-related data is securely stored, with role-based access controls to ensure patient confidentiality and data integrity.
- **Notification System**: Automated reminders for upcoming appointments via email or SMS to improve appointment adherence.
- **Appointment History**: Patients and providers can access a history of previous appointments and relevant records.

## 4. Project Instructions:

### Technologies:
- **Backend**: Use **Spring Boot** to create secure microservices.
- **Database**: Use **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** for managing user, appointment, and health records.
- **Security**: Implement **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and **OAuth** for third-party login options.
- **Frontend**: Use **React** or **Angular** for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- **Notifications**: Integrate an email/SMS service (like **Twilio** or **SendGrid**) for appointment reminders.
- **Compliance**: Ensure the system follows privacy standards such as **HIPAA** for the protection of patient data (if relevant to the region).

### Tips for Building Your Final Project:
1. **Implement Core Features First**: Focus initially on building secure authentication and appointment scheduling functionalities.
2. **Version Control**: Use **Git** for version control to manage code updates and collaborate efficiently.
3. **Testing**: Develop **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **security tests** to ensure each component is reliable and protected.
4. **Data Security**: Apply encryption for sensitive data in storage and in transit. Implement **role-based access controls** to protect patient records.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the system using **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for scalability.
